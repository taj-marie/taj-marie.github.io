          THIS IS MY WEBSITE THAT I CREATED
          BECAUSE I WAS FAMILIAR WITH HTML I THOUGHT 
          THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AS EASY,
          BUT INSTEAD I HAD VERY HARD TIME 
          MOSTLY BECAUSE I HAD TO DO IT THROUGH
          PYTHON BUT, IN THE END BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO 
          FINISH IT THE END BECAUSE OF A LOT OF HELP
